# Doppler Visualizer and Script building helper
- This UI provided tools to make it easy to view what the cluster looks like and how to build a script that can create or perform actions on the cluster of nodes. The visualizer requires that an LND node is apart of the cluster at the moment and the script build does not support the full functionality of everything that can be done with the DSL, however, it has a solid start.
- install bun `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- run `bun run .doppler\build\index.js`
